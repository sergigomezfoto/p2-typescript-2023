                This planetary nebula's simple, graceful appearance is thought to be due to perspective: our view from
                Earth looking straight into what is actually a barrel-shaped cloud of gas shrugged off by a dying
                central star. Hot blue gas near the energizing central star gives way to progressively cooler green and
                yellow gas at greater distances with the coolest red gas along the outer boundary. Credit: NASA/Hubble
                Heritage Team ---- The Ring Nebula's distinctive shape makes it a popular illustration for astronomy
                books. But new observations by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope of the glowing gas shroud around an old,
                dying, sun-like star reveal a new twist. &quot;The nebula is not like a bagel, but rather, it's like a
                jelly doughnut, because it's filled with material in the middle,&quot; said C. Robert O'Dell of
                Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn. He leads a research team that used Hubble and several
                ground-based telescopes to obtain the best view yet of the iconic nebula. The images show a more complex
                structure than astronomers once thought and have allowed them to construct the most precise 3-D model of
                the nebula. &quot;With Hubble's detail, we see a completely different shape than what's been thought
                about historically for this classic nebula,&quot; O'Dell said. &quot;The new Hubble observations show
                the nebula in much clearer detail, and we see things are not as simple as we previously thought.&quot;
                The Ring Nebula is about 2,000 light-years from Earth and measures roughly 1 light-year across. Located
                in the constellation Lyra, the nebula is a popular target for amateur astronomers. Read more: <a
